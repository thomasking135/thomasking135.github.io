    <h2>Here you'll find the reasons behind my blog design</h2>  

    <div id="padding">
    <p id="bold">A Beautiful Simple Site</p>

    <p>My site was heavily inspired by the human-computer interaction researcher
    Jakob Nielsen along with Don Norman. Both were advocates of interfaces which 
    provided a match between real world interfaces which provided greater user control.
    I wanted to create a site that promoted recognition over recall and reduced
    the typical user frustrations which often came with the fear of making errors.</p>

    <br>
    <p>The aesthetic and minimalist design has been developed with consistency
    in mind and attempt to balance the harmony of design with a system which helps 
    users to easily and enjoyably migrate around the blog. I believe the consistency
    of colours and fonts contributes to a system which provides users with the control 
    and freedom they seek when browsing online.</p>

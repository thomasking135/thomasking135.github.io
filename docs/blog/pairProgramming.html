    <p>Over the week between Monday the 6th of December up until Friday the 10th of December 
        me and my partner in calculating crime Deepti Khanolkar worked on and completed the 
        calculator stretch. This was an incredibly satisfying feat for us and will be a morally
        uplifting boost for us as we prepare ourselves to enter into Bootcamp in January

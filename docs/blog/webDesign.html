    <p>During my readings, I've learnt that the most effective websites require 
        a great deal of preparation. A great site requires planning long before a single
        line of code is typed. The process contains 6 key steps:
    </p> 

    <p>The first one is centered around information gathering. It includes understanding who the app is being 
        developed for and the requirements required to deliver the project for the 
        sponsor and their users. Often this entails developing a business requirements
        report or a business analysis case.</p>

    <p>Planning is the second part which encapsulates taking the information gathered 
        and developing a plan to develop the most effective web site possible. It is 
        important to consider the resources, tools, and stakeholders that will be critical
        to building the website. It is also important to consider the assets and content 
        that will go into the site.</p>

    <p>Designing the site comes with understanding the layout. Paper prototypes might
        be developed along with wireframes, mockups, and eventually clickable prototypes or 
        Wizard of Oz prototypes to be tested by selected test participants.</p> 

    <p>Development entails taking the information gathered from the previous steps
        to code out the site and have it ready to UX testing and testing of the solution 
        itself. This might include white, grey, or black box testing or a mixture of several 
        testing techniques.</p>

    <p>The testing and delivery part entails rigorous user experience testing along with performance 
        tests of the website itself. The site has to have a solid user interface and be 
        functionally reliable for the user. It must be resilient against threats and be able
        to function when faced with cyber threats and user volumes.
    </p>

    <p>Lastly, even when a site is built it must continually be maintained to keep it 
        appealing with current design trends and to ensure that patches and updates are made to
        ensure that the site continues to serve the sponsor and their clients well.

    <p>"One embarrassing incident was when I added two numbers when I really wanted to concatenate two 
    strings. I wanted to say that “2020” is my favourite form of cricket but it came out as an addition saying 
    I like 40 cricket."</p> 

    <p>"Here was the problem:"</p>

    <p>"const num1 = 20;"</p>
    <p>"const num2 = 20;"</p>
    <p>"console.log(num1 + num2 + “ is my favourite form of cricket!”)"</p>

    <p id="bold">Solved a problem in an elegant way</p>

    <p>"I solved the above problem by going online and searching for an answer on Stack Overflow. I was quickly 
    able to understand where I had made the error and made the correction immediately."</p>

    <p>"A similar error was when I was trying to concatenate an array. In the error I had two arrays:"</p>
    
    <p>"Ar1 = [1,2,3,4,5]"</p>
    <p>"Ar2 = [6,7,8]"</p>

    <p>"When I entered:"</p>
    <p>"Console.log(Ar1 + Ar2); the console returned back"</p>
    <p>"[1,2,3,4,56,7,8]"</p>
    <p>"To correct the error, I found the solution was to use the concatenation function:
    console.log(ar1.concat(ar2));"</p>
    <p>"This returned the concatenated array correctly."</p>
    <p>"[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]"</p>
    <p>"In both cases the key to solving the problem was to step back and think through what I had done wrong. When I 
    was confused, I started taking a proactive approach to search for answers."</p>

    

    <p id="bold">What was the problem?</p>

    <p>"The problem was an error I made while trying to concatenate two strings. Instead of concatenating (joining the 
    strings) the values were numerically added."</p>

    <p id="bold">What problem solving techniques did you use?</p>

    <p>"I am always driven to finding my own solutions before calling on others. In the cases above I took time to look 
    at the error messages and tried to problem solve looking at the feedback returned from the console. After that, I 
    looked over my course notes. If that failed, I was straight onto Google."</p>

    <p id="bold">How did you feel throughout the process?</p>
    
    <p>"I enjoyed it even if there were some challenging moments. It was great when I was able to find solutions to an 
    issue I was having."</p>

    <p id="bold">What did you learn?</p>

    <p>"I learned that there are a lot of resources out there which are of great value. I also learned that there are 
    many friendly people who are only too happy to lend their assistance during my times of difficulty. "</p>

    <h1>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h1>

    <p id="bold">Pseudocode</p>

    <p>"I think pseudocode is brilliant for providing the steps to planning an effective solution to addressing any 
    coding project. It is like having a set of instructions to put together and Ikea furniture kitset."</p>

    <p id="bold">Trying something</p>

    <p>"Although it is not always the most efficient or effective solution, I often enjoy experimenting with the code 
    to see if I can figure out a solution to a problem by myself. It allows me to experiment with considering a variety of 
    logical possibilities which may work to solve a problem."</p>

    <p id="bold">Rubber ducky method</p>

    <p>"While I found this idea awkward to embrace at first, I like the idea of trying to explain a programme line by 
    line in simple natural language to a rubber duck. It allowed me to see whether I understood the code or not. I think 
    it is something I’m still trying to come to grasps in applying as a developer."</p>

    <p id="bold">Reading error messages</p>

    <p>"I became quite sound at using the debugger on VSC to check my code. I really enjoyed using the extension packages 
    to assist me in improving my programming practices too."</p>

    <p id="bold">Console.logging</p>

    <p>"The web dev inspection tools were incredibly useful for testing my code. It was great to have an accessible environment 
    where I could test and inspect my HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding at once. "</p>

    <p id="bold">Googling</p>

    <p>"As a proactive independent learner, Googling was an integral part of my learning. As I’m sure is the case with many 
    people in my cohort, Google provided a fast and responsive way to address my most pressing questions. "</p>

    <p id="bold">Asking your peers for help</p>

    <p>"I was reluctant to ask for help at first out of the desire to squarely depend on my own abilities to search for answers. 
    However, the Slack channel provided me with a wealth of eager peers only too willingly to assist me with my queries."</p>

    <p id="bold">Asking coaches for help</p>

    <p>"Again, I was hesitant about asking my facilitators for help for fear perhaps of being viewed as a lazy or even dumb 
    student. However, I must see them as an invaluable tool to my learning as a budding programmer."</p>

    <p id="bold">Improving your process with reflection</p>

    <p>"Reflecting proved an invaluable way to step away from the problem and to come back and address it afresh. It was a 
    hard approach for me to embrace at first. However, it has become an integral part of the way I address problems these days."</p>

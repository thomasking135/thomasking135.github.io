    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>

    <h2>Here is how I plan to navigate my learning during my studies</h2> 
    <br><br>

    <div id="padding">
    
    <p id="bold">What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</p>

    <p>"My long-term ambition is to become a game developer. I am a creative person and I find 
    that games have the ability to both entertain and educate us. I am interested in 
    computer-assisted learning and I would love to design and build apps that contribute to 
    learning."</p>

    <p id="bold">Provide a description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning</p>

    <p>"I am highly motivated and passionate when I am involved in the activities I undertake. 
    I take pride in the work I do and when I work in a team I like to think that my team can 
    depend on me to pull through."</p>

    <p id="bold">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in 
    yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>

    <p>"I would like to see my communication skills grow in the way in which I engage with people. 
    This not only includes fellow teammates but also in the way I interact in the future with 
    clients when it comes to assisting them in gathering the requirements needed to create 
    solutions that meet their needs."</p>

    <p id="bold">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
	An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, 
    facilitators, and industry/community representatives.

    <p>"I have allocated a quiet space where I can sit each day at a certain time so I can focus 
    on my studies without any distractions. I have set up the room so that it is comfortable to 
    reduce elements that could distract me from focussing on my studies. This includes having 
    access to inspiring music and my water cooler so that I can keep well hydrated. I also have 
    an area cleared where I can stretch and mellow out when I need some time away to digitally 
    detox."</p>


    <p id="bold">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</p>
    
    <p>"When I feel stressed or under pressure I have created a music list of songs that I know 
    will bring down my stress and cortisol levels. I have healthy snacks nearby to avoid eating 
    unnecessary junk food that will make me feel lethargic. I also plan to buy and install an 
    exercise workstation in the future to boost my energy and endorphin levels."</p>

    <p id="bold">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</p>

    <p>"I have a list of people and facilitators I can contact. I will go straight to my peers on the 
    Slack forums when I am stuck and I will not hesitate to ask questions as soon as I realise I 
    am stuck. At the same time, I am a highly proactive person and I intend to self-help myself 
    where I can. Some of the key sites I intend to use include Stack Overflow, W3Schools, Quora, 
    and Code Pen. I also will look to benefit from material provided by the Dev Academy course 
    pages and compliment this through taking courses with Udemy, LinkedIn, along with the use of 
    videos available on YouTube."</p>

    <p id="bold">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</p>

    <p>"I expect the facilitation team to guide me when I tell them about the challenges I am facing. I 
    do not want them to spoon-feed me. Instead, I want them to assist me in being able to 
    problem-solve constructively and proactively. I also hope to gain from them any advice they 
    may wish to share about their own experiences of how they dealt with being students when they once 
    took this programme of study."</p>

    <p id="bold">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other 
    things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to 
    plan these in.</p>

    <p>"My major commitments will be my job and caring for two elderly individuals. I am the owner-operator 
    of my own business which is a 7-day a week operation. I also am caring for my elderly mother and uncle 
    who are both quite unwell. Despite these challenges, I love my present job along with the duty of caring 
    for my uncle and mother whom I both love dearly."</p>

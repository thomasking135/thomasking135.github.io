    <p>HTML was a great speaker. However, people often did not take him as seriously as they should. 
    They knew he had ideas to share with them but they found this information was difficult to access. 
    People just didn't know how to read him. Then one day he met CSS. She could really make things beautiful. 
    She found him worldly but in need of some serious brightening up. They quickluy fell in love and came 
    to realise they could make magic together. Websites that wowed people with both content, clarity, and 
    beauty. When JS came into the world, the HTML, CSS and all the browsing world lived happily ever after.</p>

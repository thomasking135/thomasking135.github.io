        <h3>How to Remove/Add a File Using CLI</h3>
    
        <p>To create a file using Git Bash I used the command <strong>'touch'</strong> followed by the name of the file I 
            wanted to create. For instance, I created a file called kitty.txt by first creating a directory
            by entering the command <strong>'mkdir Meow'</strong> and then creating the file by typing 'touch kitty.txt'. I 
            then added some text to this file by entering the command 'echo "Hello Kitty!" > kitty.txt'. To 
            view the file had been created, I entered the command 'ls' and I saw that it had been created 
            on my computer. I opened it by entering the command 'start kitty.txt'.

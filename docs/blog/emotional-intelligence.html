    <p id="bold">What is emotional intelligence?</p>

    <p>My understanding of emotional intelligence is that we can be in control and positively use our emotions 
    in ways that benefit ourselves and others. Understanding our emotions and knowing how to be in control of 
    them can help us to lead more productive, happier, and more fulfilling lives. It can also solidify the 
    relationship we have with others.</p>

    <p id="bold">The difference between emotional intelligence and IQ?</p>
    <p>IQ represents your capacity to solve problems whereas EI represents one's ability to apply and manage 
    their emotions to effectively problems solve.</p>

    <p id="bold">Why is it important?</p>
    <p>Emotional intelligence is important because when one is effective at managing their emotions they can 
    lead more satisfying and fulfilling personal and professional lives. I can deliver health benefits including 
    increased happiness, reduced stress, and improved clarity in thoughts and actions which benefit the individual 
    and those around them. It can contribute to mindfulness, improved attention, and the establishment of positive 
    mental habits. It can also be beneficial for our self esteems and the way we interact with others. It can 
    lift our leadership and reduce the tensions which can creep into our relations with others.</p>

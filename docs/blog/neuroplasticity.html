    <p id="bold">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</p>

    <p>"Neuroplasticity provides people with the confidence that it is never too late to learn new things. 
    It provides people with the belief that they can always enhance their skillset and knowledge provided 
    they are driven to do so. The brain is a flexible tool and benefits from regular use just like any part 
    of the body. If it is properly stimulated it is capable of learning new and wonderful things."

    <p id="bold">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit</p>
    <p>"In my case, I am going to take baby steps in my learning to assimilate more IT knowledge into my memory. 
    I am going to ensure that I take efforts to solidify the knowledge I’ve learned by taking review sessions to 
    ensure that I commit the knowledge firmly in my memory." 

    <p id="bold">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</p>
    <p>"The activities I’m going to use to improve my neuroplasticity include doing kata/code challenges and 
    getting my hands' dirty playing with code. I intend to watch a lot of videos as I am a visual learner."</p>

    <h1>Research Growth Mindset</h1>
    
    <p id="bold">Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</p>
    <p>"A growth mindset is the belief one has in their ability to learn through the effort and strategies they apply to their learning."</p>

    <p>"It is relevant because one needs to have the belief that they have the power to learn provided that they practice and place effort into their learning."</p> 

    <p id="bold">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</p>
    <p>"Yes, I think an understanding of the growth mindset has given me the confidence to embrace the idea that I will 
    succeed in my learning provided I place the right effort and energy into my learning."</p>

    <p id="bold">How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</p>
    <p>"I think I will do apply a growth mindset to my learning by setting clear and achievable goals. I will set regular 
    challenges and tests for myself to measure my progress and I will learn to embrace struggles as part of my learning journey."</p>

    <p>"The benefit of having a greater comprehension of neuroplasticity and growth mindset is that it has heightened my desire to learn. It has helped 
    me to reduce my fears towards feeling anxious during my learning and to strengthen each achievement I accomplish during my studies 
    regardless of how small it may seem."</p>

    <h1>Margins, Borders, and Padding? Things That Make You Go...Hmmmm</h1>

    <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h2>  

    <div id="padding">
    <p>In CSS, a margin is the space around an element’s border, while padding is the 
    space between an element’s border and the element’s content. Put another way, the 
    margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls 
    the space inside an element.</p> 

    <p>On the other hand, padding is located inside the border of an element.</p>

    <p>CSS margins determine the space surrounding an element. Therefore, margins can be used to
    change an element's position on a page, set the distance between nearby elements,
    and overlap elements.</p>

    <p>CSS padding determines how content looks within its respective element. Padding can
    be adjusted to add space between content and its border and to change the size of an 
    element.</p>

    <p>The border is the layer of the CSS box model that sits between margin and padding. By 
    default, the border does not have any width, but you can set one with the CSS border property.</p>

    <p>Margin and padding are always parts of an element, even if there’s no visible border. The image 
    below illustrates the differences between the 3 terms:</p>

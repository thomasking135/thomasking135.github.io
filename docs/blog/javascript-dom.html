    <h2>Here you'll find my reflections and technical understanding on Javascript and The DOM</h2>  

    <div id="padding">
    <p id="bold">An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</p>

<p>I would use the analogy of a house to describe the relationship between HTML and CSS. HTML is 
like the house itself. The structure and the framework. You could live in the house but it wouldn’t 
feel like a home. CSS is like the contents. The furniture, the ornaments, and the comforts that style 
a house and make it a home. CSS gives the house personality and style.</p>

<p id="bold">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 
'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth. (But not those).</p>

<p>An analogy I might use to explain the relationship between control flow and loops is a parent talking 
to a child. The parent is always reminding the child to do their homework and the loop continues over 
and over as the child receives this information. This information may come in conditional loops. For 
example, the parent may say if you do your homework you can have ice cream. The loop cycle will include 
while and for loops which can be influenced by circumstances and situations. For instance, while school 
is true, the student must do their algebra.</p>

<p id="bold">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</p>

<p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is like a tree that shows the relationship between parts of a document. 
Branches of the tree end in a node and each of these nodes contain objects.</p>

<p>To interact with it you might access it by clicking on a web page and selecting inspect. One can 
then explore and even manipulate the DOM by going into the elements tab and looking at the different tags. 
Different nodes can be opened to explore the content of each tap. These can be edited and changed to see 
effects appear on the browser without actually changing the code.</p>

<p id="bold">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</p>

<p>Objects represent things with many properties while arrays store lists of data in single variables. Objects 
are mutable data structures in javascript which are used to represent a ‘Thing’. This could be anything like 
cars, plants, people, community, etc. It stores the data in key-value pair and the key can be anything except 
for undefined. The keys are iterable and can be accessed in any order.</p>

<p>Arrays are objects only in javascript. The major difference is that they store the data in an ordered collection 
in which the data can be accessed using a numerical index. They are also mutable and data can be modified at any 
index. Indexes are zero-based which means the first item is stored at the Oth index, the second at first, and 
so on, the last item is stored at the n-1th index.</p>


<p id="bold">Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</p>

<p>A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates 
a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where 
there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.</p>


<p>Functions are useful as they reduce the need for repeating code promoting the acronym DRY (Don’t repeat yourself). 
Functions are also useful as they are reusable and can be recalled multiple times. </p>

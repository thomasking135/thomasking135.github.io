        <h2>Understanding Git Messages</h2> 
    
        <h3>Comprehension of The First GIT Message</h3>
        
        <img src="../images/gm1.JPG" width="100%" class="center"><br>

        <p>The first message provides a status update that informs the user that the branch is 
            two steps ahead of the main branch in the MD file. The user has the ability to stage and commit these 
            changes. It appears as if the file is modified. 
        </p>

        <h3>Comprehension of The Second GIT Message</h3>

        <img src="../images/gm2.JPG" width="100%" class="center"><br>
    
        <p>In the second returned Git message, a fetch and push is performed. The pull 
            of online files is performed from the URL provided and there is a message which
            appears saying that there are file conflicts in the diverged branch and 
            main/master copies. The files are modified and a deletion is made. Changes 
            not staged for the commit are performed. The console returns the user to the main/master 
            branch.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Comprehension of The Third GIT Message</h3>
        
        <img src="../images/gm3.JPG" width="100%" class="center"><br>   
    
        <p>The third files provides a list of commits which shows the dates and times
            aking with the authors of the commits. The message tracks and highlights the 
            history of the commits in the MD file.
        </p>

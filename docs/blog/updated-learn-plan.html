    <h1>Updated Learning Plan</h1>

    <h2>Here is my updated learning plan</h2> 
    <br><br>

    <div id="padding">
    
    <p id="bold">What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</p>

    <p>"My desire to become a game developer remains. I realise this comes through my ability to 
    work with others and to have a better understanding of how I work not only in understanding and 
    working with others but understanding and developing myself."</p>

    <p id="bold">Provide a description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning</p>

    <p>"I think my skills in listening and meditation will need to evolve if I wish to achieve my ambitions. 
    Having faith in my abilities to grow along with a positive shift in my growth mindset will help to get 
    me onto the path of achieving my goals."</p>

    <p id="bold">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in 
    yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>

    <p>"I would like to see my ego shift from squarely relying on myself to having the courage to interact with 
    others more to get their insights on issues I may require help with. I think there is a lot of benefits that 
    can be derived from getting help from others. "</p>

    <p id="bold">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
	An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, 
    facilitators, and industry/community representatives.

    <p>"I will be taking the time to interact more with my peers and with my facilitators. I will not shy away 
    from asking for their insight and sharing my work with others."</p>


    <p id="bold">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</p>
    
    <p>"When I feel stressed or under pressure I will take the time to be kind to myself. I will
    employ strategies to manage my emotions and to ensure I do not exhaust myself with any unnecessary
    stress."</p>

    <p id="bold">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</p>

    <p>"Along with my peers and mentors, I intend to take advantage of the many helpful people online that can 
    lend some kindly assistance in aiding my progress."</p>

    <p id="bold">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</p>

    <p>"I now expect my facilitation team will not roll their eyes at me if I bring a question to their attention. 
    I now understand that they are there to help me grow as a person and as a developer."</p>

    <p id="bold">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other 
    things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to 
    plan these in.</p>

    <p>"I still have the challenges of caring for two elders in my life. However, I now feel confident that there 
    are many resources available to me to support me on my learning journey."</p>

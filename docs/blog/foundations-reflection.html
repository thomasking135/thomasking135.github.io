    <p id="bold">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</p>

    <p>"For me, it is that I need to learn to have greater confidence in myself. To do this, I need to improve the trust I place 
    in others to help me achieve my goals. I must move away from solely taking it upon myself to feel as if I have to do everything 
    myself. I think the core tasks have shown me these limitations but that I can acknowledge these weaknesses and what I need 
    to do to improve my learning as a programmer and as a human being. This will be vital in an environment where working with my 
    team and clients is at the core of most IT jobs. This is something I perhaps did not understand so well at the start of the course."</p> 
    
    <p id="bold">What is the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</p>
    <p>"They are far greater than what I first gave them credit. At the start of the course, I don’t think I appreciated the 
    relevance of studying these ideas. However, I don’t think one could now be a good tech apprentice without some appreciation 
    of these concepts. Tech roles serve and build applications for humans. To be good at coding without understanding who you are 
    building these goods for does not serve any potential programmer well. I now understand and appreciate the core materials we 
    covered in this course and appreciate the naïve perceptions I have now abandoned about IT just being about coding which I came 
    into the course possessing."</p> 

    <p id="bold">What has surprised you the most about core learning?</p>
    <p>"I think the importance of getting to understand oneself during the journey. In particular, taking the time to understand how 
    bettering oneself emotionally helps to improve one's ability in programming itself. I really can appreciate and see the value now 
    of meditation, taking breaks, and taking time to reflect. I did not hold this belief coming into the programme."</p>

    <p id="bold">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p>
    <p>"Probably working in pairs for myself. This is something I had never undertaken before and I was unsure how this experience would 
    turn out. It was great from teaching me how to respect and value the interpretations of a fellow human being who shared similar fears 
    and desires to my own. The experience overall was highly pleasant and insightful and has been an invaluable value to my evolution and 
    growth mindset as both a programmer and a better human being."</p> 

    <p id="bold">Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development 
    boot camp course?</p>
    <p>"I think now because we are much more involved in working with and for people than I originally thought. This was a lesson that 
    seems so obvious now to me but which initially would not have made sense to me."</p>

    <p id="bold">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to 
    practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</p>
    <p>"No, on the contrary, it was perhaps the best part. I think it will go a long way to making me a better person overall and 
    hopefully a programmer who my peers and clients will respect and trust. I think it has helped me to learn how to better regulate 
    my emotions which in turn has helped me to code better. It has also taught me to seize advantage of the many problem solving 
    tools out there rather than relying on one dominant set."</p>

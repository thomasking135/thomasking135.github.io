    <h1>The some() and sort() Methods</h1>

    <h2>Here you'll find my reflections and understanding of two Javascript methods</h2>  

    <div id="padding">
    <p id="bold">What is the some() method and why would you use it?</p>

    <p>This method tests to see if any array elements pass a test. It is a useful function for determining 
    the existence or non existence of items in an array. It can be useful in helping to better understand the 
    contents of an array.</p>

    <p>const pies = [4, 9, 16, 20];</p>

    <p>pies.some(checkPies);</p> 
    <p>function checkPies(pies) {</p> 
    <p>return pies > 18; }</p>

    <p>The return on the console would be true as their are some pies greater than 18.</p>

    <p>However if the function was changed to return pies > 20 the return on the console would be false as there 
    are no volume of pies greater than the 20 which exist.</p>

    <p id="bold">What is the sort() method and why might you use it?</p>
    <p>The sort() function is commonly used. It allows one to sort elements of an array into a desired returned order. 
    The default sort order is ascending. This works works numbers and alphabetical items. This method is good for clearly 
    organising elements and easily finding elements in an array. It can also be combined with the reverse() method which 
    shows items in a descending order. This can be useful when looking for higher or lower values.</p>

    <p>const cars = ["Mitsubishi", "Toyota", "Honda", "Nissan"];</p>
    <p>cars.sort();</p>

    <p>What would be returned is the vehicles in alphabetical order</p>

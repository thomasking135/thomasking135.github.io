    <p id="bold">Why I built a JS Quiz?</p>

    <p>I am a big quizer and I love sitting down with my mother and uncle to watch quizzes everyday! I have attempted
        to build a quiz which has a user friendly interface that presents the user with clear choices and clarity with 
        the responses returned. This has been done to minimalise the risk of user errors whilst taking the quiz. This has been achieved
        by reducing the choices presented to the users and the application of colours and spacing to empower the participant to 
        make confident and clear choices. Correct and incorrect anwers are clearly highlighted through the application of meaningful
        colours (i.e. green for correct and crimson for wrong). The font chosen has been selected for its clarity and 
        has been set on a background which does not overpower it creating potential accessibility headaches for users with visual 
        impairments.</p> 

    <p>I hope you enjoy my JS-centric quiz. It only contains 3 questions which I'm sure you will answer with ease!</p>

        <h3>How to Remove/Add a File Using CLI</h3>
    
        <p>To create a file using Git Bash I used the command <strong>'touch'</strong> followed by the name of the file I 
            wanted to create. For instance, I created a file called kitty.txt by first creating a directory
            by entering the command <strong>'mkdir Meow'</strong> and then creating the file by typing 'touch kitty.txt'. I 
            then added some text to this file by entering the command 'echo "Hello Kitty!" > kitty.txt'. To 
            view the file had been created, I entered the command 'ls' and I saw that it had been created 
            on my computer. I opened it by entering the command 'start kitty.txt'. 
        </p>

        <p> After creating this kitty.txt file, I decided I wanted to delete it from the 'Meow' directory.
            This was achieved using the command line <strong>'rm kitty.txt'</strong>. To confirm this had been performed, I
            entered the command <strong>'ls'</strong> and I could see it was no longer inside the 'Meow' directory I had
            created.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Stream a File Through CLI</h3>
    
        <p>I created another new text file in the 'Meow' directory. I named it 'furball.txt'. This was done 
            using the <strong>'touch'</strong> command folowed by the filename and the type of file I wanted to create. After
            a quick check using the 'ls' command I could see that the file existed in the directory. I then 
            entered some text into it using the command <strong>'echo "Hi there kitten friends' > furball.txt'.</strong> I then
            decided to stream or open the the file by entering the command 'start furball.txt'. The notepad
            file opened immediately and I could see what I had entered. 
        </p>

        <h3>How to Find and Look Inside Files Using the CLI</h3>
    
        <p>To navigate around files, I used the <strong>'cd'</strong> or change directory command line. When I found a directory
            I wanted to open, I entered the <strong>'cd'</strong> command followed by the folder or directory name. To see what 
            was inside the directory, I would enter the 'ls' command. From there, I would select further folders
            using <strong>'cd'</strong> command. To go back to a previous folder, I would often use the <strong>'cd .. '</strong> command. Or, I
            would use the <strong>'cd'</strong> command and eneter the folder/directory name. I often used the 'ls' command as a 
            guide to ensure I wouldn't get lost combing through files.
        </p>
    
        <h3>How to Get Help Using the CLI</h3>
    
        <p>When I had forgotten commands or if I ever became confused, I frequently used the <strong>'git help'</strong> command
            to provide me with a list of the commands available to help me navigate around the CLI.

    <p>This is my version of the minesweeper game. It is functional however improvements could 
        certainly have been made to the game in animated effects, added audio, and a reset button
        rather than resetting the game by refreshing the page. The board could also have been 
        made larger to create a more challenging game environment.
    </p> 

    <p>I tried to create a cheery and fun environment with the application of emotional colours
        and the images provided through the source files and my own added funny gif image.
    </p>

    <p>Here is the link to the game which is hosted by our good friends at Pro Free Host. Enjoy!</p>
